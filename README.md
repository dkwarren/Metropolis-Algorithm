# Metropolis-Algorithm
A Metropolis Algorithm for Statistical Thermal Physics
This was the final project of my PHY 441 Statistical and Thermal Physics class. It
takes an amount of particles then causes a perturbation in one of the particles, and
it keeps track of the energy levels until it reaches an equilibrium where the energy
perturbation does not change anything. This is a model for a very simple Einstein Solid
using the energy levels of a spin 1/2 harmonic oscillator.
